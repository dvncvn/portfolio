  "summary": "Langflow had accumulated years of experience debt. The UI was dated, the mental model was inconsistent, and the product no longer reflected the pace or expectations of modern AI development.\n\nIn parallel with a brand refresh, I led a full end-to-end redesign of the platform to modernize Langflow quickly and decisively.\n\nI owned the entire product surface. Information architecture, interaction patterns, visual language, and shipped quality.",

It became a major driver of top-of-funnel growth and increased Astra DB consumption on our cloud platform.\n\nA major redesign helped put Langflow on stage with Jensen Huang. During my time as lead designer, Langflow grew from 14k to 144k GitHub stars.\n\nThe response to the work was strong, both internally and externally.\n\nOverall, I helped evolve Langflow from a promising prototype into a modern developer tool that belongs in today's AI stack.",
