  "summary": "Langflow had accumulated years of experience debt. The UI was dated, the mental model was inconsistent, and the product no longer reflected the pace or expectations of modern AI development.\n\nIn parallel with a brand refresh, I led a full end-to-end redesign of the platform to modernize Langflow quickly and decisively.\n\nI owned the entire product surface. Information architecture, interaction patterns, visual language, and shipped quality.",

I rebuilt core platform patterns so Langflow scaled from \"powerful but noisy\" into a coherent, modern developer tool.\n\n- Established hierarchy and navigation with consistent layouts, clearer entry points, and better signposting across the product.\n- Reduced cognitive load through progressive disclosure, cleaner density, and more predictable interaction patterns.\n- Made execution feel trustworthy by clarifying what runs, what it costs, and what happened, without forcing users into raw internals.\n- Created reusable platform primitives (templates, inputs, model/provider management) that support ongoing iteration, not one-off screens.",

After the redesign, Langflow was polished and credible enough to be featured publicly, including on stage at NVIDIA GTC. During my time as lead designer, Langflow grew from 14k to 144k GitHub stars, with strong reception both internally and externally.",
