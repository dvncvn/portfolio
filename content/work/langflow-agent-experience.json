  "summary": "Langflow began as a general-purpose AI/ML workflow builder. As agents emerged as the dominant pattern for building with AI, the product pivoted toward an agent-first experience. I led the design of Langflow’s first native agent model and helped re-architect the canvas to better reflect how agents are actually built, reasoned about, and extended.",

It became difficult to distinguish the agent itself from its tools, models, and data sources.\n\nWe evolved the canvas to make agents first-class citizens with clear structure. An agent owns its model, tools, and data, and the UI needed to reflect that relationship explicitly. This shift aligned the product with developers’ mental models and made complex agent workflows easier to understand, debug, and scale.",

The shift significantly changed how the product was positioned, sold, and adopted, and made Langflow a stronger strategic asset during its acquisition by IBM.\n\nWorking closely with another designer, I helped drive core product strategy. Our agent-first approach was more than a year ahead of comparable offerings and informed long-term roadmap planning across the Langflow product organization.",
